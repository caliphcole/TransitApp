    <!--About description-->
     <string name="about_body">This android application displays nearby bus timing information and bus routes that JUTC operates.
                        This application utilizes the GPS built in to your smart phone to pinpoint your
                        location. The application will then tie you to the nearest bus stop and display a list of the buses arriving
                        at that bus stop in the order of arrival time.
